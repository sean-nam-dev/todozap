## ⚙️ How It Works
TodoZap uses a **local Room database** to store notes and tasks offline. The app synchronizes with a **custom PHP REST backend** via Retrofit and OkHttp, and **WorkManager** ensures background sync even when the app is closed. Conflict-handling logic guarantees data integrity across devices.

## 🧠 Highlights / Learning Outcomes
- Built full offline/online sync logic with background workers  
- Designed a modular architecture to enable fast feature development  
- Implemented efficient conflict resolution and caching for smooth UX
